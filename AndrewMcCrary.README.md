## Desired Project
Ideally, I would like to pursue something of great interest to me.  Anything academically stimulating or efficiency driven interests me from a technology point of view.  Above that, I am interested in the financial sector.  An automated stock trading algorithm checks all three of these boxes, so that is my current top choice.  Any pure software project, other than web applications since I've done that for the past three years, is of interest to me.
